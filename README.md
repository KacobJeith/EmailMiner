#EmailMiner
This script attempts to automate the excruciating process of searching for relevant email addresses. 

At present, the script grabs profiles from a Houzz webpage query, and collects all websites that are linked from the Houzz profiles. The script then visits each website, and performs an exhaustive search throughout the main page, any immediate linked subdirectories, and any links referencing the words ['team', 'about', 'contact'].
